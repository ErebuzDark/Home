                When I was a kid, I always play with my younger brother near at the railroad of Hermosa Tondo. 
                Also with my friends, we like to climb trees, play text and pogs.

                March, year 2014 I graduated at F.G Calderon Elemetary School. I really grateful to my parents 
                for their hardship and sacrifices. My Father was a pedicap driver while my Mother is a housewife.

                 last one James, my younger brother.

                2018 when I graduated Highschool my sister is very proud at me. Since my Father got sick my sister 
                became the breadwinner of our family. She teach English subject at Paco Catholic School for 5 year. 
                But now she flew to Indonesia to find more oppurtunities like larger teaching pay.

                Because of the policy Grade 11 and 12, I need to take these level before entering college life.
                My loving and caring Aunty supports my education and I got a priviledge to study at Notre Dame of Greater Manila.
                At first I'm really grateful and happy but super nervous at the same time. I dont know if because 
                I'am now a senior student or because of the new environment and it is my first time to study in privite school
            </p>

            <p style="text-indent: 50px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
                Senior Highschool life is very interesting, they are preparing us to become ready on college life.
                 And this oppurtunity that I'd got helps me a lot to perform and develop my skills.
            </p>

            <p style="text-indent: 50px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
                I realized that life is like a dance that full of steps and memorizing, we just need to be ready to execute our best performance.
